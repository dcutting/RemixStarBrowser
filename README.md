# RemixStarBrowser

This repo is a simple app demonstrating how to use the Remix architecture with FitNesse for subsecond UI flow testing.

* Clone the repo
* Open `RemixStarBrowser.xcworkspace` in Xcode
* Build the `AcceptanceTests` scheme
* Run `./LaunchFitnesse` in terminal from the root of the repo
* Click through to the [`AllAcceptanceTests.StarBrowser`](http://localhost:8080/AllAcceptanceTests.StarBrowser) page

Fixtures for these tests are in the `RemixStarBrowser/StarBrowser/Fixtures` group in Xcode.
